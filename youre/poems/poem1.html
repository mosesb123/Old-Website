Misfire of Justice
Ruthie Vogel

Oh say can you see
That standing here, together,
We are easier to kill?
You shouldn’t have to.
School should be a place of safety –
Not a war zone.

What so proudly we hailed
As one of our rights
Was meant only to protect 
From the threat of a government;
It was not meant 
To murder children

Through the perilous fight
Seconds were hours
As their classmates died around them
And they were forced to wonder:
What kind of country
Do we live in?

Our flag was still there
But it had failed in its duty
Where is Domestic Tranquility?
Since when did the right to life
Become less important
Than that of brutality

The land of the free
Is filled with the grieving
And the brave are not soldiers
But children
Forced to live, forever
With tragedy
